# scrolls
- An AI powered story generator tool. Made for writers. Scrolls is a text editor specifically built to leverage the capabilities of NLG models that allow us to apply the feature of auto-complete not just to words, but also to sentences and paragraphs. This allows us to use auto-complete by predicting what could come next in a pattern of text, and then send suggestions to the user based on the input.
